# Uni portfolio

Here I've included what is most of the assessed coursework I've created for BSc (Hons) Ethical Hacking (and electives) so far. I hope whoever stumbles upon this finds it useful. I also hope that it is obvious not to plagiarise this (you will be found out). Thank You! :)

**Coursework:**
- Portfolio:
  - Weekly quizzes
  - Coding exercies
  - Software design exercises
- Project - develop a program that simulates a 501 darts game.

**Grade:** B+

### CMP 110 - Introduction to Security

**Description:** Introduction to the issues and practicalities involved in securing computer systems and the framework within which computer security specialists would need to operate.

**Coursework:**
- Group presentation on cybersecurity laws in the UK and an another country (our group chose Russia).
- A small research project related to an topic of computer security that interests me. I chose steganography. [(Link)](https://antinatura.github.io/uni/documents/CMP110_Unit2_Report.pdf).

**Grade:** A

### ELE 019 - The Secret Life of Language

**Description:** Foundations of sociolinguistics and the connections between language, identity, and power. Examines a range of linguistic issues, including the idea of standardisation, how language is structured, and the ethics of modern communication.

**Coursework:**
- Presentation on the discourse communities in my life.
- Analysis of a piece of writing provided to me. [(Link)](https://antinatura.github.io/uni/documents/Assignment_2.pdf)

**Grade:** B+

## Year 2

### CMP 201 – Data Structures and Algorithms 1

**Description:** Looks at the standard data structures and algorithms that form the core of algorithmic thought in computer science, and the idea of reasoning about the behaviour and performance of a computer program.

**Coursework:**
- Weekly quizzes
- Implementation and presentation of two algorithms that solve the same problem. For the problem I chose string searching and implemented Boyer-Moore-Horspool and Rabin Karp algorithms. [(Link)](https://github.com/antinatura/CMP201)

**Grade:** A

### CMP 204 – Secure Web Development (FKA Dynamic Web Development 1) 

**Description:** Introduction to dynamic web applications, through client-side and server-side internet development.

**Coursework:**
- Quiz
- Develop a web application based around a musical band or solo artist making use of client-side and server-side dynamic content. For my artist I chose Beach House. [(Link)](https://github.com/antinatura/CMP204)

**Grade:** A+

### CMP 210 – Penetration Testing (FKA Ethical Hacking 1)

**Description:** Develops an understanding of tools used in the industry to perform security analysis of a device or a network. Introduces the methodologies of penetration testing.

**Coursework:** Perform a security test on a typical company network and report the findings. I was given a virtual network of a fictitious company and had to follow penetration testing methodology to evaluate its security. [(Link)](https://antinatura.github.io/uni/documents/CMP210_pentest_report.pdf)

**Grade:** A+

### CMP 202 – Data Structures and Algorithms 2

**Description:** Foundations of parallel programming on shared memory and GPU architectures and the design techniques underpinning parallel applications, using a range of case studies drawn from typical real-world applications.

**Coursework:**
- Weekly quizzes
- Code and present a program that demonstrates the use of CPU or GPU multithreading in C++. Using a template provided to me I developed a multihreaded calculation of the mandelbrot set that outputs a progress bar on runtime. [(Link)](https://github.com/antinatura/CMP202)

**Grade:** A

### CMP 209 – Digital Forensics 1

**Description:** Examines the basic technology and techniques used to investigate cybercrime. A systematic approach to planning and implementing a comprehensive computer forensic investigation is introduced with a particular focus on evidence collection and the reconstruction of events therefrom.

**Coursework:** Case study group project where members of the group must undertake a forensic investigation of a computer seized under the suspicion of it containing illicit materials (in this scenario they were pictures of birds). [(Link)](https://antinatura.github.io/uni/documents/JASAN_Digital_Forensics_JohnDoeCase.pdf)

**Grade:** A+

### ELE 012 – Film and Game Genres

**Description:** Studies the cultural codes and formal content underlying the composition of popular cultural genres, as these are realised traditionally through films, and more contemporaneously through video games.

**Coursework:**
- Short report/essay about Steve Neale's argument that *genres are defined by the qualities of similarity and difference*. [(Link)](https://antinatura.github.io/uni/documents/CW1.pdf)
